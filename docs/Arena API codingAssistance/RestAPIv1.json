    "description" : "The Arena REST API provides methods for accessing a resource, such as an Item or a category of Item, at a canonical URL. You can then perform an action upon that resource by specifying an endpoint URL, such as https://api.arenasolutions.com/<version>/items/<item_GUID>/revisions which returns all revisions for a given Item resource. Note that the version takes the format e.g. v1 (no decimal places). The API version does not necessarily change with Arena releases.<br><br>The header of all requests must include:<br>- an access token \"arena_session_id\" for user authentication (except Log In, which grants a token)<br>- a content type declaration (\"application/json\", except for file POST endpoints with content, where the file metadata is JSON and the file payload itself is \"multipart/form-data\")<br>- an HTTP method declaration (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)<br><br>Requests must be sent uncompressed. Responses may be returned uncompressed or compressed using gzip encoding.",
